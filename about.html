      <h2>About Pittsburgh Dominion</h2>
      <p><strong>Pittsburgh Dominion</strong> is a 14U AAA independent hockey association built for elite summer competition. We operate outside traditional league structures, allowing us to focus on high-performance development, showcase exposure, and a tight-knit team culture.</p>

      <p>Our mission is to provide top-tier athletes with the tools, coaching, and branding they need to stand out on and off the ice. From custom media kits to national tournament play, Dominion is more than a team—it’s a statement.</p>

      <p>We’re based in the greater Pittsburgh area and recruit from premier Tier 1 programs across the region. Our players are selected for skill, character, and commitment to excellence.</p>
